                    Have you at anytime witnessed a relative of yours or a close
                    friend searching frantically for a blood donor, when blood
                    banks say out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach
                    and the time keeps ticking? Have you witnessed loss of life
                    for the only reason that a donor was not available at the
                    most needed hour? Is it something that we as a society can
                    do nothing to prevent? This thought laid our foundation.

                    "Friends2support" is an organization that brings voluntary
                    blood donors and those in need of blood on to a common
                    platform.&nbsp; Through this website, we seek donors who are
                    willing to donate blood, as well as provide the timeliest
                    support to those in frantic need of it. <br />

                    Started in the year 2005, on 14th Nov, in a small room with
                    just 100 voluntary donors but with the zeal to serve our
                    society, to inspire and spread the word, we dream to fulfill
                    100% blood need in India.
